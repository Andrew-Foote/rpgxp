- Web interface to database (working on)
- On-the-fly rendering for web UI, for convenience when developing
- Handle Materialbase
- Profile generate_db_data and remove anything making it unnecesssarily slow
- Have a way to regenerate schema/data for only one file (e.g. Map001.rxdata),
  leaving anything from other files untouched as much as possible
- Maybe use APSW's row tracer thing to generate objects from rows rather than
 unpacking tuples all the time
