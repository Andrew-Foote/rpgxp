- Web interface to database (working on)
    - Show hue for tileset fogs/panoramas
    - Show tile passages/priorities/terrain flags for tilesets
- Profile generate_db_data and remove anything making it unnecesssarily slow
- Have a way to regenerate schema/data for only one file (e.g. Map001.rxdata),
  leaving anything from other files untouched as much as possible
- Maybe use APSW's row tracer thing to generate objects from rows rather than
 unpacking tuples all the time
- We could get the game title from the Game.ini file
- View materialization
  - If we want to materialize an existing view we should still keep that view around and just make it "redirect" to a new one
  - We need to ensure the data is fully populated before materializing a view
- Handle arry fields as lists (tile passages, enemy element ranks, etc.)
